[![HuggingFace space](https://img.shields.io/badge/ðŸ¤—-HuggingFace%20Space-cyan.svg)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/shgao/EditAnything)

This is an ongoing project aims to **Edit and Generate Anything** in an image,
powered by [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything), [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet),
[BLIP2](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS/tree/main/projects/blip2), [Stable Diffusion](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion), etc.

Any forms of contribution and suggestion
are very welcomed!

## Edit Specific Thing by Text-Grounding and Segment-Anything
### Editing by Text-guided Part Mask
Text Grounding: "dog head"

Human Prompt: "cute dog"
![p](images/sample_dog_head.jpg)

<details>
  <summary> More demos. </summary>
    
Text Grounding: "cat eye"

Human Prompt: "A cute small humanoid cat"
![p](images/sample_cat_eye.jpg)
    
</details>

### Editing by Text-guided Object Mask
Text Grounding: "bench"

Human Prompt: "bench" 
![p](images/sample_bench.jpg)

## Edit Anything by Segment-Anything

Human Prompt: "esplendent sunset sky, red brick wall"
![p](images/edit_sample2.jpg)


<details>
  <summary> More demos. </summary>
    
Human Prompt: "chairs by the lake, sunny day, spring"
![p](images/edit_sample1.jpg)
    
</details>


## Generate Anything by Segment-Anything

BLIP2 Prompt: "a large white and red ferry"
![p](images/sample1.jpg)
(1:input image; 2: segmentation mask; 3-8: generated images.)

<details>
  <summary> More demos. </summary>

BLIP2 Prompt: "a cloudy sky"
![p](images/sample2.jpg)

BLIP2 Prompt: "a black drone flying in the blue sky"
![p](images/sample3.jpg)

 </details>

1) The human prompt and BLIP2 generated prompt build the text instruction.
2) The SAM model segment the input image to generate segmentation mask without category.
3) The segmentation mask and text instruction guide the image generation.

## Generate semantic labels for each SAM mask.
![p](images/sample_semantic.jpg)
```
python sam2semantic.py
```

Highlight features:
- Pretrained ControlNet with SAM mask as condition enables the image generation with fine-grained control.
- category-unrelated SAM mask enables more forms of editing and generation.
- BLIP2 text generation enables text guidance-free control.
